        i had the thought of putting improvs on my website, so something triadic and consonant to start <br>
        practicing the ravel toccata with very slow progress (ughhh!!); inspired some of the sounds here <br>
        <br>
        note to self: phone on top of piano gets better audio than phone on side<br>

        listen to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E23GvbtKXt0">poulenc improvisation no 7!!</a> it's good!! <br>
        ending chords are crazy<br>
        
        <br>
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRSGWhPV_68">short piece in 17edo</a> with lots of ivory sounds <br>
        
        <br>
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1rklL4qkPE">nyiregyhazi's rach 2 mvmt 2</a> stunned me the first time i heard it<br>
        the phrases suggest emotions that are "too vast" and it was an eye opening listen! actually enjoyed it quite a bit<br>
        i think i was led here from a review by The Independent Pianist, where he shares his opinion on why his vall√©e d'obermann is bad<br>
        and then a comment in there about how he (nyiregyhazi) was really good in this reimagining of mvmt 2<br>
        
        <br>
        ...anyways
